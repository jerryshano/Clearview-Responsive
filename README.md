# Responsive website built using HTML, CSS and Javascript 
## This is a responsive website I built for an assisted living facility.

This project is a website a built for my family business in order to increase business and drive up our income. The website responds to everydevive width you can throw at it. This is becuase I wrote a media query for every time the website broke upon viewport width reduction. You may view the website online by [clicking here](https://clearviewcarehomes.com/)
