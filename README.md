# Responsive website built using HTML, CSS and Javascript 
## This is a responsive website I built for an assisted living facility.

This project is a website a built for my family business in order to increase business and drive up our income. The website responds to everydevive width you can throw at it. This is becuase I wrote a media query for every time the website broke upon viewport width reduction. You may view the website online by [clicking here](https://clearviewcarehomes.com/)

## Here is a quick Demo

<div style="width:360px;max-width:100%;"><div style="height:0;padding-bottom:57.78%;position:relative;"><iframe width="360" height="208" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameBorder="0" src="https://imgflip.com/embed/6kfw96"></iframe></div><p><a href="https://imgflip.com/gif/6kfw96">via Imgflip</a></p></div>
